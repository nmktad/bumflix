# Bumflix | HLS, Adaptive Bitrate Streaming, more

Bumflix is a video streaming platform built to deliver high-quality adaptive bitrate
streaming using HLS (HTTP Live Streaming).
This project demonstrates how to serve videos in multiple resolutions implement
scalable streaming platform (including higher than 1080p)
and provides basic content protection.

## Features Planned

- **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming):** A widely-used streaming protocol that supports
  live and on-demand video.
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR):** Supports multiple video quality levels
  to optimize the streaming experience based on network conditions.
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Utilizes AWS services such as S3
  (or MinIO for local setups) for video storage and CloudFront for content delivery.

## Tools used

- **Localstack:** A widely-used streaming protocol that supports
